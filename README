STEPS TO RUN THE BACKEND AND FRONTEND

1. From the command line, go into the webservice directory
   1a) Run: npm install
   1b) Run: node app.js
   This will start up the backend webservice which will be listening on localhost:4000
2. From the command line, go into the webapp directory
   2a) Run: npm install
   2b) Run: npm run dev
   This will start up the frontend app which will be listening on localhost:3000
3. In a browser go to: http://localhost:3000

I've worked very little with NodeJS and not at all with Vue/Nuxt. I was able to get the
backend working in about half the time, but I'm getting stuck on the frontend. I see the
request coming in to the backend when I click the submit button, but I can't figure out
how to get the results to show up in the front end.
